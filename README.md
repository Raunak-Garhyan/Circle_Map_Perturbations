The computational exploration of the Devil’s Staircase and Circle Map dynamics was carried out using a Python-based Jupyter notebook. The script was structured to compute and visualize both the original and modified versions of the circle map, analyze their winding number behaviors across parameter sweeps, and display the resulting Devil’s Staircase and Arnold tongues. In addition, the Spyder IDE was used as our interactive development environment.
The overall coding workflow followed a structured pipeline: First, the mathematical functions defining the circle map (both standard and perturbed) were implemented using NumPy operations. The winding number, then, was estimated numerically by simulating thousands of iterations of the circle map and computing the average angular displacement. These values were collected over a sweep of parameters (e.g., varying driving frequency Ω and nonlinearity K) to construct Devil’s Staircase plots and two-dimensional Arnold tongue maps.
